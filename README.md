# obliterate-implicit-cd README

## Features

### Concepts

This extension obliterates "implicit `cd`" all over the world.

Students or begginer enginners sometimes struggle with installing libraries or applications.
That's because the instructions of many GitHub softwares are based on common sense.
To avoid that, the installing instructions should be kind so that their users just have to copy and paste the code blocks on `README.md`.

### Functions

On a markdown file, a warning appears if the first sh/bash/powershell codeblock does not start with `cd`.

## Requirements

Nothing is required.

## Extension Settings

No settings.

## Known Issues

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Obliterate Implicit cd.
